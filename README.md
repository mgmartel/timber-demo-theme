timber-starter-theme
====================

With Redux Framework theme options, based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mgmartel/7863800).

Simply updating the `etc/sections.php` file add options to the Timber Option menu, which in turn is accessible in all of your templates through the `{{options}}` object. Simple as that.

Both Timber and Redux Framework need to be activated as plugins before this works.
